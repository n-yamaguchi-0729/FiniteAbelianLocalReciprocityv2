# No nontrivial everywhere-unramified extension of ℚ

The global Kronecker--Weber argument forms a fixed field which is unramified
at every finite prime.  Minkowski's
discriminant bound to show that this field is ℚ.  This file records that
source theorem directly in terms of the local unramified predicates on the
prime ideals of the ring of integers.

/-- A number field unramified at every prime over ℤ has degree one over ℚ.

The proof first shows that its different ideal is the unit ideal.  Its
absolute discriminant therefore has absolute value one, while the
Hermite--Minkowski bound says that every number field of degree greater than
one has absolute discriminant greater than two. -/
