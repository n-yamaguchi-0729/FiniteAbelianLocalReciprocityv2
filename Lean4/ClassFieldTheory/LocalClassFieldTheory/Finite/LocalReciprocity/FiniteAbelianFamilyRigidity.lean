# Rigidity from a cyclic quotient and subgroup data

A finite abelian quotient is determined by its action on all intermediate
subgroups together with its action on a sufficiently large cyclic quotient.
The group-theoretic statement below isolates the part of uniqueness of a
coherent local Artin family that does not involve fields or valuations.

/-- Two homomorphisms into an abelian group coincide if every subgroup
containing a value of the first also contains the corresponding value of the
second, and if they agree after passage to a cyclic quotient whose generator
order annihilates the target. In the local Artin application the cyclic
quotient is supplied by an unramified extension. -/
