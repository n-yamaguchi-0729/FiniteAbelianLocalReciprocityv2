# Existence of the abelian conductor

The conductor of a finite abelian extension is the least modulus whose ray
class field contains that extension. The older theorem name
`embedsInRayClassField_iff_conductor_le` remains available for compatibility;
its conclusion is an existence statement, so this name reflects its type.
