# Finite abelian local reciprocity

This module states local reciprocity for a finite abelian extension `L / K`
of a nonarchimedean local field.  The assumptions provide the finite
abelian-Galois extension together with the valuative topology on `K`.  The
conclusion supplies a surjective continuous homomorphism from `Kˣ` to the
Galois group whose kernel consists exactly of nonzero field norms from `L`.

This finite quotient statement deliberately leaves the usual uniformizer
normalization and tower functoriality to separate compatibility theorems; it
does not claim that the displayed witness is uniquely determined.
