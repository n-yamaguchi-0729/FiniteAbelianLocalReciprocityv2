# Membership in the field-norm subgroup

This module gives the concrete meaning of the public predicate
`IsFieldNorm`.  For a finite-dimensional extension of fields `L / K` and a
unit `x` of `K`, it states that `x` belongs to the range of the unit-valued
field norm exactly when some unit of `L` has algebra norm equal to `x`.
No Galois, local-field, or topological assumption is required.
