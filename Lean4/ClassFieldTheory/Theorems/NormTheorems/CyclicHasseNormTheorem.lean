# The cyclic Hasse norm theorem

This module states the local-to-global norm principle for a finite cyclic
Galois extension `L / K` of number fields.  For a unit `x` of `K`, the
conclusion identifies membership in the global field-norm subgroup with the
condition of being a norm after base change to every finite and infinite
completion of `K`.
