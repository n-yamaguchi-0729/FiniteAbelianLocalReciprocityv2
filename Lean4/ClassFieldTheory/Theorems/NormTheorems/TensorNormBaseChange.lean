# Determinant norm and scalar extension

For a finite field extension `L / K`, the norm of `y : L` is unchanged by
base change, in the sense that the determinant norm of `1 ⊗ y` over a
commutative `K`-algebra `A` is the image of its field norm over `K`.
This applies to the whole tensor algebra, whether or not it is a field.
