# Images of subgroups in restriction kernels

This file isolates a group-theoretic criterion for identifying the image of
a subgroup with the kernel of a homomorphism after a surjective quotient.

/-- Suppose `φ` is surjective, the kernel of `ψ.comp φ` is `Z ⊔ U`, and `Z`
is already killed by `φ`. Then the image of `U` is exactly the kernel of `ψ`.
